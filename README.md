# Unexpected warning when calculating mean of empty subset in R

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in R related to handling empty subsets of data frames. When subsetting a data frame and the resulting subset is empty, attempting to perform operations like calculating the mean can lead to unexpected warnings or errors. The provided code showcases this issue and a solution to gracefully handle such cases.

## Bug Description

The R code attempts to calculate the mean of a column in a subset of a data frame. However, the subsetting condition leads to an empty subset. This results in a warning when `mean()` is applied to an empty vector.  This behavior can be problematic if not handled appropriately.

## Solution

The solution involves checking for empty subsets before applying any operations.  The solution demonstrates how to gracefully handle the scenario using a conditional check, preventing errors and enhancing code robustness.
